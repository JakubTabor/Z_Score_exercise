# Z_Score_exercise
# Thanks to my previous calculations now i can calculate my "zscore"
# I create new column "zscore" calculating it by use of "mean" and "std" """df['zscore'] = (df.Height - df.Height.mean())/df.Height.std()"""
# And check how "zscore" was calculated """(65.78331 - 67.99311359679999) / 1.9016787712056105""" that's the numerical interpretation of pattern above
